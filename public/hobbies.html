    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>As a Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelor of Science, my passion for problem-solving extends far beyond the workplace. I'm driven by a constant desire to learn and a curiosity that fuels both my professional and personal life. When I'm not immersed in an engineering project, you can find me embracing an adventure in the great outdoors. I'm an avid mountain biker, hiker, and camper, always seeking new trails and challenges. This love for an active lifestyle and competitive sports continually inspires my work and my approach to finding innovative solutions.</p>
